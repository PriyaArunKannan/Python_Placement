# Placement Eligibility & Student Performance Dashboard

A fully interactive Streamlit-based application designed to manage and track student placement readiness using real-time filters, SQL analytics, and object-oriented programming principles.

## ✅ Project Overview

This project helps placement teams and training coordinators:

1. Filter students based on dynamic eligibility criteria.
2. Visualize performance in programming and soft skills.
3. Track placement readiness across batches and graduation years.
4. Gain data-driven insights using SQL and dashboards.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

### 🧱 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

   1. Created a DBManager class to handle all database operations.
   2. Promotes code reuse, modularity, and scalability.

### 2. Streamlit for Dashboard UI**

   1. Used st.sidebar, st.selectbox, st.slider, st.dataframe for interactivity.
   2. Sidebar filters dynamically control the student eligibility queries.
   3. Insights are selected via dropdown and rendered in real time.

### 3. Relational Databases (SQLite)**

   1. Four normalized tables: Students, Programming, SoftSkills, and Placements.
   2. Relationships managed using student_id as a foreign key.

### 4. Faker Library for Data Generation**

   1. Automatically populates realistic student data.
   2. Simulates enrollments, performance, and placement outcomes.

### 📊 5. SQL for Data Analytics**
   1. Over 10 insights using aggregate functions (AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY).
   2. SQL joins used to relate tables and extract insights.
   3. Queries include filters for placement status, internship count, and batch analysis.

### 📈 6. Interactive Data Filtering**

 Filters on:
        - Problems Solved
        - Mock Interview Score
        - Assessments Completed
        - Average Soft Skill Score
        - Placement Status
        - Course Batch & Graduation Year

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

        Frontend: Streamlit
        Backend: Python 3 (OOP)        
        Database: SQLite        
        Data Generator: Faker        
        Data Processing: Pandas        
        Query Language: SQL (SQLite syntax)

## 🧪 Environment Setup
🔹 **Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
 Using venv (built-in Python module):

                        python -m venv myenv
                        
 This creates a folder named myenv/ containing your virtual environment.

🔹 **Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment**

                ✅ On Windows:

                        myenv\Scripts\activate
                
                ✅ On macOS/Linux:
                
                        source myenv/bin/activate
                        
                Once activated, your terminal prompt will change, indicating you're inside the virtual environment.
